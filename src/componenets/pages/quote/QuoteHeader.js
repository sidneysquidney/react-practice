          <p>
            Get an initial quote to help you understand how much your window
            cleaning will cost. This will be subject to change on viewing of the
            property by the cleaner, or on a more thorough quote made upon
            bookings. Each quote starts at a minimum charge of £30, then works
            it way up depending on a number of factors - number of windows, size
            of windows, and hard to reach places etc. We also offer conservatory
            cleaning and gutter cleaning so every box can be ticked in a single
            trip.
