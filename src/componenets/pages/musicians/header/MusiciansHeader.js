            If you use our window cleaning service… then you support the arts!
            But how? It has become increasingly difficult for an artist’s full
            potential to blossom. Yet music and art are something we value most
            within our society. We hire student musicians and artists offering
            them free professional training and (with your help!) a steady flow
            of window cleaning work, private music tuition, concert
            opportunities and publicity to support their creative ambitions. ​
          </p>
          <p className="musicians-last-p">
            Teaching alone is not always the best way for a musician to make
            money if their goal is to pursue a career in performance. It can be
            time consuming and mentally draining for a relatively small amount
            of money. An Artists Touch provides window cleaning training and
            work to up and coming musicians that helps to support their studies,
            while we use our community and website to offer instrumental
            teaching, musician bookings and a platform to share their concerts
            and other creative endeavours.
